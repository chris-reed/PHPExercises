# RTSLabs - Exercises

### Exercise 1.

Based on the wording of the exercise, I went with the assumption that the number inputted will not appear in the array.
Otherwise I would have checked to see how many occurrences of the inputted integer were in the array, and altered the total accordingly.

### Exercise 2.

I feel like there is a better way to do this, but this was the quickest that came to mind.
It ain't pretty, but it works.

### Exercise 3.

This is a tough one.

The first thing that came to my mind was, I wish I could change PHPs perception in the development community. Go to Reddit, or other places developers congregate, and PHP is treated like a red-headed stepchild. And I say that as a red-headed stepchild.

But seriously, my biggest gripe with most frameworks is documentation. I can handle a lot of questionable decisions made by framework developers, if the documentation is good.
