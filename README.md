# PHP - Exercises

### Exercise 1.

Based on the wording of the exercise, I went with the assumption that the number inputted will not appear in the array.
Otherwise I would have checked to see how many occurrences of the inputted integer were in the array, and altered the total accordingly.

### Exercise 2.

I feel like there is a better way to do this, but this was the quickest that came to mind.
It ain't pretty, but it works.
